## Advances in Game Technology

5 senses:
- Sight     (Displays)
- Hearing   (Speakers)
- Touch     (Haptic feedback)
- Smell
- Taste

### History of displays and VR

1. Braun tube (1897)
2. Cathode Ray Tube
3. PAL (Phase Alternating Line)
4. Sword of Damocles (1968), VR

VR in the 1970's and 1980's was used by research, military and nasa

5. LCD
   1. Flatter, Lighter, Initially slow response time

Results of LCD:
1. Virtuality (Arcade only)
2. Sega VR (never released)
   1. Too slow processor
   2. Too slow screen
   3. Simulation sickness
3. Mobile phones
   1. low cost, high dpi, small form factor screens
4. Oculus

### History of controllers

First: Tennis for 2

Pre-1980
- Pong, Video Pinball, Magnavox Odyssey
- Expensive hardwore
- Single purpose consoles/controllers
- Lots of "pong" clones
- Lots of "wheel" type controllers

1980's and 1990's
- Rise of the multi-game console
- Need for a multipurpose controller
- Joystick (2D)

1990's and 2000's (increased complexity)

1. ATARI 2600 Joystick
2. NES pad (Sticky kamer unit)
3. SNES Controller
4. PS2 DualShock (zoals we m nu kennen)

2000's and 2010's: Motion controllers
- Software is better
- Hardware is cheaper

Now
- VR Controllers
- Touch screens

### Haptics

1. Fonz (1976), TX-1 (1983)
2. Star Fox 64 (1997)
   1. Rumble pak (trillen)
3. Rez (2001)
   1. Trance vibrator
4. Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro (1997)
5. SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel (1997)
   1. Vibrations, Steering force
6. Force Dimension (2001-present)
   1. Medical, research
7. Novint Falcon (2007)
   1. First Consumer 3D haptic device
8. Disney AIREAL and Microsoft AirWave (2013)
9. Gloves

### Trends and future

#### **Displays**
VR drives screens specs further
- (DPI, Screen door, Resolution, Refresh rate)
AR requires new screen types
- (No passthrough, waveguides, prisms)

#### **Controllers**
Evolution over?
- (Stable design, no obvious improvements)
Hardly used features
- (capacitive touch, motion sensing, force sensing)
Force feedback?
- (vibrations, adaptive triggers)

#### **Haptics**
VR Haptics
- Must interface with different tracking methods
- Be compatible
- Be generic

1. Tactical Haptics (2013)
   1. Reactive Grip
2. Haptic vests
3. Haptic Gloves
4. Omni-Directional Treadmills (walking)
5. Motion Platform/Simulator
6. Ultimatate Battlefield 3 simulator (2011)
