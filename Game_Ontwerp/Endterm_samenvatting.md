# Samenvatting Game Ontwerp deel 2

## Advances in Game Technology

5 senses:
- Sight     (Displays)
- Hearing   (Speakers)
- Touch     (Haptic feedback)
- Smell
- Taste

### History of displays and VR

1. Braun tube (1897)
2. Cathode Ray Tube
3. PAL (Phase Alternating Line)
4. Sword of Damocles (1968), VR

VR in the 1970's and 1980's was used by research, military and nasa

5. LCD
   1. Flatter, Lighter, Initially slow response time

Results of LCD:
1. Virtuality (Arcade only)
2. Sega VR (never released)
   1. Too slow processor
   2. Too slow screen
   3. Simulation sickness
3. Mobile phones
   1. low cost, high dpi, small form factor screens
4. Oculus

### History of controllers

First: Tennis for 2

Pre-1980
- Pong, Video Pinball, Magnavox Odyssey
- Expensive hardwore
- Single purpose consoles/controllers
- Lots of "pong" clones
- Lots of "wheel" type controllers

1980's and 1990's
- Rise of the multi-game console
- Need for a multipurpose controller
- Joystick (2D)

1990's and 2000's (increased complexity)

1. ATARI 2600 Joystick
2. NES pad (Sticky kamer unit)
3. SNES Controller
4. PS2 DualShock (zoals we m nu kennen)

2000's and 2010's: Motion controllers
- Software is better
- Hardware is cheaper

Now
- VR Controllers
- Touch screens

### Haptics

1. Fonz (1976), TX-1 (1983)
2. Star Fox 64 (1997)
   1. Rumble pak (trillen)
3. Rez (2001)
   1. Trance vibrator
4. Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro (1997)
5. SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel (1997)
   1. Vibrations, Steering force
6. Force Dimension (2001-present)
   1. Medical, research
7. Novint Falcon (2007)
   1. First Consumer 3D haptic device
8. Disney AIREAL and Microsoft AirWave (2013)
9. Gloves

### Trends and future

#### **Displays**
VR drives screens specs further
- (DPI, Screen door, Resolution, Refresh rate)
AR requires new screen types
- (No passthrough, waveguides, prisms)

#### **Controllers**
Evolution over?
- (Stable design, no obvious improvements)
Hardly used features
- (capacitive touch, motion sensing, force sensing)
Force feedback?
- (vibrations, adaptive triggers)

#### **Haptics**
VR Haptics
- Must interface with different tracking methods
- Be compatible
- Be generic

1. Tactical Haptics (2013)
   1. Reactive Grip
2. Haptic vests
3. Haptic Gloves
4. Omni-Directional Treadmills (walking)
5. Motion Platform/Simulator
6. Ultimatate Battlefield 3 simulator (2011)
   
## Player types & Game patterns

Studies suggest that most players channel their morality into their avatar and would exect others to do likewise.

### User personas
Be as specific as possible about which player experience you are designing for.

1. Different players find different kinds of games enjoyable
2. Different players may enjoy the same game for different reasons
3. Whether or not a game is enjoyable is relative

User Persona is a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are
synthesized from data collected from interviews with users

- Name
- Demographics
- Personality
- Biography
- Motivations
- Goals
- Pains
- Bartle (Social, achiever, explorer, killer)

### Some basics

#### **game patterns**
Certain game patterns foster & encourage distinct types of play behaviour

Examples:
- Competing
- Cooperative play (co-op)
- Self expression

#### **player skill level**

Games are played by people of different skill level, but need to be enjoyable for all level players.

Novice: guide, get used to game machanics, build up difficulty

Expert: provide fresh activities, content or challenges.

### Player types

Two overarching forms of player segmentation:
1. Designer theories
2. Empirical models

#### **Bartle's player types**
1. Achievers
   1. Tend to engage in activities only if it contributes to a particular goal
2. Explores
   1. Try to find out as much as they can about the game environment
3. Socializers
   1. Interested in relatonships with other players and in organizing player
4. Killers
   1. Interested in defeating opponents, causing disruption.

*Idea*: Every person typically exhibits traits from all four types when playing a game, but many people tend to lean more heavily toward one of the types

#### **ACE2 model**
More focus on enjoyment derived from Aesthetics

![](plaatjes/ace2.png)

#### **LeBlanc's taxonomy of game pleasures**
1. Sensation (aesthetics)
2. Fantasy
3. Narrative
4. Challenge
5. Fellowship (co-op)
6. Discovery
7. Expression (creating)
8. Submission
   1. leaving the real world behind

#### **Caillois' patterns of play**
He found most thinking on lay was too much focused on the concept of *competitiveness*

1. Agôn (Competition)
2. Alea (Chance)
3. Mimicary (Simulation or Role Play)
4. Ilinx (State of Dizziness and Disorder)

Caillois imagines each of the four types of games to exist on a continuum between *spontaneous/free play* and *higly structured rule-based play*

#### **The Big Five personality model**

1. *Openness* to experience
2. *Conscientiousness*
3. *Extraversion*
4. *Agreeableness*
5. *Neuroticism*

The extent to which personality is expressed within video game environments, is strictly modulated by the *game mechanics*

#### **Yee's gamer motivation profiles**

Motivation types
- Action
- Social
- Mastery
- Achievement
- Immersion
- Creativity

Three clusters of game motivation:
1. *Action-social cluster*: Excitement, destruction, community, competition
2. *Mastery-achievement cluster*: Completion, strategy, challenge
3. *Immersion-creativity cluster*: Story, design, fantasy

Bridges:
- Discovery
- Power

Link between Big Five
- Higher openness -> higher preference for fantasy, story, design and discovery
- Higher extraversion -> higher preference for excitement, competition and community
- Higher conscientiousness -> weak correlation with strategy preference
  
### Potential biases

#### **Frustration tolerance**
Frustration is typically defined as “an interference with the occurrence of an instigated goal-response at its proper time in the behaviour sequence”
- there needs to be a *goal*
- some type of satisfaction derived from attaining that goal needs to be anticipated

6 main factors that mediate the strenght of the respnse to frustration:
1. The extent to which an individual expected satisfaction from the attainment of the goal
2. The extent to which the goal was blocked
3. The number of in-sequence frustrated responses
4. The legitimacy of the goal block
5. The deliberateness of a block
6. The anticipaton of failure

frustration can cause:
- decreased attention
- reduced memory retention
- reduced learning ability
- decreased motivation to resolve a state of being stuck

#### **Other potential biases**

- Overconfidence effect
- Illusion of control
- Fundamental attribution error
- Peak-end rule
