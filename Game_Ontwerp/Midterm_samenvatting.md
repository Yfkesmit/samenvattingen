## 02 - User-centered Game Design

### Game design models

#### **Affirmative Design**

improve or dress up past succes

#### **Critical Design**

Critical design aims to critique the traectory of certain game design patterns.
Tries to offer an alternative that responds to a trend.

#### **Playcentric Design**

decanteren en itereren tot je beste versie van je game hebt

#### **MDA**
Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics. Frame de design keuzes tussen player experiences en designer intenties.
Nu MGP Framework

### MGP Framework
#### **Logic**
1. Players interact with different game *objects* and perform various *actions*
2. Interacting with the game and other players over time creates
*gameplay*.
3. Gameplay gives rise to specific *experiences* and *feelings* in each
player

#### **Design approaches**
1. Top-down design
   - Player Experience -> Mechanics
2. Bottom-up design
   - Mechanics -> testing -> desired player experience

### User personas
Capture who our users are, in detail, as people living their daily lives, and imagine why and how they would want to play the game.

### Flow in Games (and Everything Else)

People seek personal happiness and pleasure.
Flow represents the feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfillment.

eight major components of Flow:
- A challenging activity requiring skill;
- A merging of action and awareness;
- Clear goals;
- Direct, immediate feedback;
- Concentration on the task at hand;
- A sense of control;
- A loss of self-consciousness; and
- An altered sense of time

In order to maintain a user's Flow experience, the activity must balance the inherent challenge of the activity and the player's ability to address and overcome it.

In order to design an interactive experience for a broader audience, the experience cannot be the same for all players or users, so many choices have to be offered.

design should follow a four-step methodology:
- Mix and match the components of Flow;
- Keep the user’s experience within the user’s Flow
Zone;
- Offer adaptive choices, allowing different users to
enjoy the Flow in their own way; and
- Embed choices inside the core activities to ensure
the Flow is never interrupted.

## 03- Player Motivation: The Art of Failure
*What motivates people to (keep) playing video games?*

### The Art of Failure
People prefer playing games in which they fail.

*paradox of failure*
1. We generally avoid failure,
2. We experience failure when playing games,
3. We seek out games, although we will experience something that we normally avoid

failure is a *motivator*

### Goal Blocking
blocking in games is expected an acceptable behaviour.

### Attribution theory
We try to attribute events to certain causes:
- Person
- Entity
- Circumstances

three dimensions of how we deal with failure:
1. Internal vs. External
2. Stable vs. Unstable
3. Global vs. Specific

### Feeling responsible for outcomes...
Players rate the game significantly higher when they felt responsible for failure than when they did not.

### A panorama of Play - A literature review
#### *Children's perspective on play*
From children’s perspectives, play is
important for their enjoyment of life and what it means to be a child in the here-and-now

children's own concepton of play is activities where freedom and agency is high with minimal adult involvement. 'free play'

Risk-taking is a common feature of children's free play.

Children’s play has its own culture that is different and distinct to that of adults, and
which adults may have trouble accessing or understanding

#### *Theorising the value of play*
play is often still regarded as the opposite
of work, with playtime only earned when work is complete.

three main societal orientations to play:
- culturally curtailed
- culturally accepted 
- culturally cultivated

*Play as valuable for development*

Spencer: let off steam by playing after completed tasks
Groos: play as preparation for later life.

free play is seen as providing children with
greater opportunities to use their imagination, be creative and experiment
